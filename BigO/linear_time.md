O(n) - Linear Time:
-------------------

Definition: An algorithm has O(n) time complexity if the running time grows linearly with the input size. In other words, if you double the input size, the running time will also double.

Example: Linear Search
Linear search is a classic example of an O(n) algorithm. It involves searching for a target value in an unsorted array by checking each element one by one.
