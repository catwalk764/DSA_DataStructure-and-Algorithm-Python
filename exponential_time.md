O(2^n): Exponential Time:
------------------------
What It Means:

An algorithm is said to have O(2^n) time complexity when its running time doubles with each additional element in the input. This is typically seen in algorithms that solve problems by exploring all possible combinations or subsets of the input.

Recursive Method:
----------------

This implementation uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number. Each call to fibonacci(n) results in two additional calls to fibonacci(n - 1) and fibonacci(n - 2), leading to a large number of function calls for higher values of n.

Iterative Method:
-----------------
This implementation uses an iterative approach with a for loop to calculate the Fibonacci number. It initializes two variables, a and b, to represent the last two Fibonacci numbers and iteratively updates them until it reaches the desired number.

Efficiency
Recursive Implementation:

Time Complexity: O(2^n)
----------------------
The recursive method has exponential time complexity due to the repeated calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers. For larger values of n, this becomes inefficient and leads to a lot of redundant calculations.

Space Complexity: O(n):
---------------------
The space complexity is due to the call stack that grows with each recursive call.

Iterative Implementation:
------------------------
Time Complexity: O(n)

The iterative approach only goes through the loop once for each Fibonacci number up to n, making it linear in terms of time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1):
---------------------

The space complexity is constant because it only uses a fixed number of variables regardless of the size of the input.
