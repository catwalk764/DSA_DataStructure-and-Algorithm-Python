Two Pointers Approach for Removing Duplicates:
----------------------------------------------

The Two Pointers approach is an efficient technique used to solve problems involving sorted arrays, such as removing duplicates. In this method, two pointers are utilized: one to traverse the array and the other to track the position to write unique elements.

Note: This method is specifically designed for sorted arrays. If you need to remove duplicates from an unsorted array, additional steps (such as sorting or using a hash set) would be required.
