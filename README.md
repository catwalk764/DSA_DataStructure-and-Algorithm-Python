- Introduction:
Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for programming. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some important topics and algorithms you should focus on:

- Data Structures:
  1.Arrays: Basic operations, finding duplicates, merging arrays.
  2.Strings: Manipulations, substring search, anagrams.
  3.Linked Lists: Single and doubly linked lists, reversing a linked list, detecting cycles.
  4.Stacks: Implementation, using stacks for expressions (e.g., balanced parentheses).
  5.Queues: Implementation, circular queues, priority queues.
  6.Hash Tables: Implementing a hash map, collision resolution strategies.
  7.Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), balanced trees (AVL, Red- 
    Black).
  8.Graphs: Representations (adjacency list/matrix), depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), shortest path 
    algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford).
  
- Algorithms:
  1.Big O notation.
  2.Sorting Algorithms: Bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and understanding time complexity.
  3.Searching Algorithms: Linear search, binary search.
  4.Recursion: Understanding the concept and solving problems using recursion.
  5.Dynamic Programming: Basic principles, examples like the Fibonacci sequence, coin change problem, and knapsack problem.
  6.Greedy Algorithms: Coin change problem, activity selection.
